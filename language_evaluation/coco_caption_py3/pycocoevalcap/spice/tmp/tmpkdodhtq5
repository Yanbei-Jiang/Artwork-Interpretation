      "painted early in 1500 just before his 29th birthday it is the last of his three painted self-portraits",
      "art historians consider it the most personal iconic and complex of his self-portraits",
      "art historians note the similarities with the conventions of religious painting including its symmetry dark tones and the manner in which the artist directly confronts the viewer and raises his hands to the middle of his chest as if in the act of blessing",
      "d\u00fcrer 's face has the inflexibility and impersonal dignity of a mask hiding the restless turmoil of anguish and passion within",
      "in its directness and apparent confrontation with the viewer the self-portrait is unlike any that came before",
      "it is half-length frontal and highly symmetrical its lack of a conventional background seemingly presents d\u00fcrer without regard to time or place",
      "the placement of the inscriptions in the dark fields on either side of d\u00fcrer are presented as if floating in space emphasizing that the portrait has a highly symbolic meaning",
      "the lightness of touch and tone seen in his earlier two self-portraits has been replaced by a far more introverted and complex representation",
      "in this work d\u00fcrer 's style seems to have developed into what art historian marcel brion described as a classicism like that of ingres",
      "geometric analysis of the composition demonstrates its relatively rigid symmetry with several highlights aligned very close to a vertical axis down the middle of the painting",
      "in 1500 a frontal pose was exceptional for a secular portrait in italy the conventional fashion for profile portraits was coming to an end but being replaced with the three-quarters view which had been the accepted pose in northern europe since about 1420 and which d\u00fcrer used in his earlier self-portraits",
      "fully frontal poses remained unusual although hans holbein painted several of henry viii of england and his queens perhaps under instruction to use the pose",
      "late medieval and early renaissance art had developed the more difficult three-quarters view and artists were proud of their skill in using it to viewers in 1500 and after a frontal pose was associated with images from medieval religious art and above all images of christ",
      "the self-portrait is of a markedly more mature d\u00fcrer than both the 1493 strasbourg self-portrait and the 1498 self-portrait which he produced after his first visit to italy in both of these earlier paintings he had highlighted his fashionable hairstyle and clothing and played on his youthful good looks",
      "d\u00fcrer turned 28 around 1500 the time of this work",
      "in the medieval view of the stages of life 28 marked the transition from youth to maturity",
      "the portrait therefore commemorates a turning point in the artist 's life and in the millennium the year 1500 displayed in the centre of the upper left background field is here celebrated as epochal",
      "moreover the placing of the year 1500 above his signature initials a.d. gives them an added meaning as an abbreviation of anno domini",

      "reynolds 's division of orme 's face into light and dark halves has been noted by critics for its insight into the effect on orme of the battle and the loss of comrades",

      "douglas fordham agrees and describes the painting as an innovative work that updates the established genre of the full-length portrait which was typically of an aristocrat born to his position to include a display of the sensibility expected of a gentleman in the 18th century and to show a man who had achieved his position through his own talents like joshua reynolds who also was not from an aristocratic background",
      "in that respect fordham argues orme was symbolic of a changing england where merit was beginning to matter more than connections both in soldiering and in painting",

      "he also describes the orme portrait as exemplifying reynolds 's desire to go beyond simple likeness in order to comment more generally on developments in british society in this case british military ambitions and the anxieties provoked by war",

      "it contains the first appearance in turner 's work of a swirling oval vortex of wind rain and cloud a dynamic composition of contrasting light and dark that will recur in later works such as his 1842 painting snow storm steam-boat off a harbour 's mouth",
      "turner saw parallels between hannibal and napoleon and between the historic punic war between rome and carthage and the contemporary napoleonic wars between britain and france",
      "the painting is turner 's response to jacques-louis david 's portrait of napoleon crossing the alps of napoleon leading his army over the great st bernard pass in may 1800 which turner had seen during a visit to paris in 1802",
      "turner set his painting in the val d'aosta one of the possible routes that hannibal may have used to cross the alps which turner had also visited in 1802",
      "identifying napoleon and france with hannibal and carthage was unusual as a land power with a relatively weak navy france was more usually identified with rome and the naval power of britain drew parallels with carthage",
      "a more typical symbolism linking the modern naval power of britain with the ancient naval power of carthage can be detected in turner 's later works dido building carthage and the decline of the carthaginian empire",
      "the irregular composition without geometric axes or perspective breaks traditional rules of composition",
      "it is similar to turner 's 1800-2 watercolour edward i 's army in wales painted to illustrate a passage from the poem the bard by thomas gray in which an army marches diagonally across the painting through a mountain pass and is assailed by an archer to the left of the painting",
      "turner sketched out the foreground figures as early as 1804 and had observed an impressive storm from farnley hall the house of walter fawkes in yorkshire in 1810 making notes on the back of a letter he remarked to fawkes son hawkesworth that its like would be seen again in two years and it would be called hannibal crossing the alps",
      "turner may also have been inspired by a lost oil painting of hannibal 's army descending the alps into northern italy by watercolourist john robert cozens a landscape with hannibal in his march over the alps showing to his army the fertile plains of italy the only oil painting that cozens exhibited at the royal academy and also an entry in list of imaginary paintings written by thomas gray which speculated that salvator rosa could have painted hannibal passing the alps",
      "another spur to make the painting could have been the visit of a delegation from the tyrol to london in 1809 seeking support to oppose napoleon",
      "the painting was first exhibited at the royal academy summer exhibition at somerset house in 1812 accompanied in the catalogue with some lines from turner 's unfinished epic poem fallacies of hope",
      "turner insisted that the painting should be hung low on the wall at the exhibition to ensure it would be viewed from the correct angle",
      "it was widely praised as impressive terrible magnificent and sublime",

      "this fact along with the man 's unusually direct and confrontational gaze have been taken as an indication that the work is a self-portrait",
      "probably his portrait of margaret van eyck was a pendant although her only known portrait is both dated 1439 and larger",
      "it has been proposed that van eyck created the portrait to store in his workshop so that he could use it display his abilities -lrb- and social status given the fine clothes evident in the portrait -rrb- to potential clients",
      "however his reputation was such in 1433 that he was already highly sought after for commissioned work",

      "the costume is appropriate for a man of van eyck 's social position and the motto is his personal one otherwise only appearing on two surviving religious paintings two more known only from copies and the portrait of his wife",
      "in none of these is it as prominent as here a primary reason along with the very direct but bloodshot gaze why the work is usually viewed as a self-portrait",

      "a similar chaperon is worn by a figure in the background of van eyck 's rolin madonna and it has also been suggested that this is a self-portrait",
      "depicting the lines and folds of a chaperon would allow an artist to overtly display his skill",
      "more so the positioning of its long cornette may directly refer to his occupation as a painter it is rolled up perhaps to keep it out of way as he freely applies paint",
      "the emphasis on the sitter 's sharp and keenly intelligent shot eyes is a further subtle clue one found again later in albrecht d\u00fcrer 1500 self-portrait",

      "the painting was purchased by the art historian and collector wilhelm uhde and formed part of his collection until it was sequestered by the french government just before world war i.",
      "in 1921 the painting reappeared at the auction house h\u00f4tel drouot where it was presumably purchased by kr\u00f6ller-m\u00fcller and published in catalogue of the paintings in the collection of helene kr\u00f6ller-m\u00fcller",
      "and as late as 1985 bacchante was listed in jean metzinger",
      "in retrospect as belonging to the collection of the kr\u00f6ller-m\u00fcller museum",

      "la danse -lrb- bacchante -rrb- is an oil painting on canvas with dimensions 73 x 54 cm -lrb- 28.75 by 21.25 in -rrb-",
      "metzinger 's bold use of color characteristic of his work between 1904 and 1907 is highly noticeable in bacchante",
      "his brushstrokes are practically all the same size but their directions and colors vary giving rhythm to the overall work",
      "the depth of field is flattened the foreground blending in with background components",
      "the subject matter is classical reminiscent of jean auguste dominique ingres -lrb- an artist metzinger greatly admired -rrb- yet its treatment is everything but classical",
      "this early work in the divisionist style represents a bacchante -lrb- or maenads -rrb-",
      "in greek mythology maenads were the female followers of dionysus -lrb- bacchus in the roman pantheon -rrb- the most significant members of the thiasus",
      "their name literally translates as raving ones",
      "often the maenads were portrayed as inspired by dionysus -lrb- also known as bacchus -rrb- into a state of ecstatic frenzy through a combination of dancing and drunken intoxication",
      "in this state they would lose all self-control begin shouting excitedly and engage in uncontrolled sexual behavior",
      "many artists chose this subject over the centuries probably due to these dramatic characteristics",
      "she is the primary subject of the work and is framed in an exotic setting that accentuates the arching curve of her back",
      "she has a deep voluptuousness as in the works of ingres -lrb- to use the term of baudelaire -rrb- yet her timeless immobility makes her somehow chaste",
      "the scene is seemingly calm and luxurious simultaneously",
      "metzinger 's early quest for a total image explains the lack of illusory depth the profuse light and the refusal to depict a marked difference between the foreground background and the woman 's frame",
      "metzinger added a conspicuously tropical setting presumably under the influence of paul gauguin 's mahana no atua day of the gods -lrb- 1894 -rrb- or henri -lrb- lle douanier -rrb-",
      "rousseau 's le r\u00eave -lrb- two more painters the artist greatly admired -rrb-",
      "bacchante is already typical of metzinger 's style with its sumptuous textures sinuous harmony of line -lrb- for example the arching trees and foliage -rrb- and depiction of the serene attitude and chaste sensuality of the bacchante 's body all enlisted in metzinger 's quest for absolute perfection"

      "that painting shows titian in three-quarter view in an alert pose",

      "given the relatively flat pictorial plane the viewer 's attention is drawn to the sitter 's sharp facial features his high forehead hooked nose long beard and penetrating deeply set eyes",
      "here titian 's command of paint and shade marks a high point of his late period and while the physical charisma seen in the berlin picture has been diminished by age it is now replaced with a sense of authority",

      "giorgio vasari noted that by this stage in his life titian had amassed enough wealth to not depend on commissioned work or be beholden to any patron",
      "his self-portrait was intended to enhance how he was viewed by others",

      "the following summarises the speculation of recent biographers such as robb and helen langdon in 1607 caravaggio was still an outlaw at risk of being tracked down by his enemies the family of the man he had killed and naples close to rome may have seemed comparatively exposed",
      "his patrons and protectors the colonna the giustiniani the banker ottavio costa had strong links with malta and the knights and it may have been felt that joining the order would give carvaggio immediate protection and aid in procuring a papal pardon for his eventual return to rome",

      "but malaspina was not only a famous warrior he was also a commissioner for the poor orphans and widows and the painting may have been intended to emphasise both this aspect of his work and also the asceticism of the order",

      "-lrb- spanish corral de locos -rrb- is a small oil-on-tinplate painting completed by the spanish artist francisco goya between 1793 and 1794",
      "goya said that the painting was informed by scenes of institutions he had witnessed as a youth in zaragoza",
      "yard with lunatics was painted around the time when goya 's deafness and fear of mental illness were developing and he was increasingly complaining of his health",
      "a contemporary diagnosis read the noises in his head and deafness are n't improving yet his vision is much better and he is back in control of his balance",
      "though goya had to that point been preoccupied with commissioned portraits of royalty and noblemen this work is one of a dozen small-scale dark images he produced independently",
      "uncommissioned it was one of the first of goya 's mid-1790s cabinet paintings in which his earlier search for ideal beauty gave way to an examination of the relationship between naturalism and fantasy that would preoccupy him for the rest of his career",
      "he was undergoing a nervous breakdown and entering prolonged physical illness and admitted that the series was created to reflect his own self-doubt anxiety and fear that he himself was going mad",
      "goya wrote that the works served to occupy my imagination tormented as it is by contemplation of my sufferings",
      "the series he said consisted of pictures which normally find no place in commissioned works to art historian arthur danto yard with lunatics marks a point in goya 's career where he moves from a world in which there are no shadows to one in which there is no light",
      "the work is often compared to more mature but equally bleak madhouse of 1812-19",
      "it has been described as a somber vision of human bodies without human reason as one of goya 's deeply disturbing visions of sadism and suffering and a work that marks his progression from a commissioned portraitist to an artist that pursued only his bleak and pitiless view of humanity",
      "some historians speculate that goya 's symptoms may indicate prolonged viral encephalitis and the mixture of tinnitus imbalance and progressive deafness may be symptoms of m\u00e9ni\u00e8re 's disease",
      "others claim that he was suffering from mental illness",
      "however these attempts at posthumous diagnosis are purely and only speculative and hypothetical",
      "goya 's diagnosis remains unknown",
      "what is known is that he lived in fear of insanity and projected his fears and despair into his work",
      "set in a lunatic asylum yard with lunatics was painted at a time when such institutions were according to art critic robert hughes no more than holes in the social surface small dumps into which the psychotic could be thrown without the smallest attempt to discover classify or treat the nature of their illness",
      "the work stands as a horrifying and imaginary vision of loneliness fear and social alienation a departure from the rather more superficial treatment of mental illness in the works of earlier artists such as hogarth",
      "in a 1794 letter to his friend bernardo de yriarte he wrote that the painting shows a yard with lunatics and two of them fighting completely naked while their warder beats them and others in sacks -lrb- it is a scene i witnessed at zaragoza -rrb-",
      "it is usually read as an indictment of the widespread punitive treatment of the insane who were confined with criminals put in iron manacles and routinely subjected to physical punishment in ground sealed by masonry blocks and iron gate",
      "here the patients are variously staring sitting posturing wrestling grimacing or disciplining themselves",
      "since one of the essential goals of the enlightenment was to reform the prisons and asylums a subject found in the writings of voltaire and others the condemnation of brutality towards prisoners whether criminal or insane was a subject of many of goya 's later paintings",

      "these elements include the apparition of the virgin before the donor whose panel contains carvings that seem to be reflective of events of his life",
      "in his religious panels after 1436 van eyck 's reliance on iconographical or symbolic elements is greatly reduced",
      "ward speculates the reduced size of the work or the wishes of the commissioner influenced this choice or he decided that he had exhausted the most interesting possibilities and much of his carefully planned symbolism went unappreciated by patrons or by viewers",
      "according to jacobs the work reflects a system of symbolism in so far as heavenly and earthly objects are juxtaposed",
