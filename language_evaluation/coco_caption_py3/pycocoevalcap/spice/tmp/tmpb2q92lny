      "in essence however zoffany has amalgamated the traditional subject of a gallery view much exploited by flemish painters in the seventeenth century with the conversation piece evolved by british painters during the eighteenth century although recently other more cryptic levels of meaning have been sought in the picture.royal patronage enabled the artist to have the venus d'urbino by titian taken down from the wall for copying after the grand duke of tuscany -lrb- ferdinando i -rrb- had specifically decreed that the picture had been copied too much and should not be moved again for such a purpose.correspondingly there are one or two references in the picture to the royal collection the virgin and child by raphael held by the artist was a work that was offered to george iii by earl cowper -lrb- this is the niccolini-cowper madonna now in the national gallery of art washington -rrb- and the samian sibyl by guercino seen at the lower edge of the composition is a pendant to the libyan sibyl by the same artist bought by george iii in the 1760s the tribuna of the uffizi is a technical tour de force",
      "the setting is therefore somewhat idealised but it remains a perfectly accurate representation of the significance of the tribuna for eighteenth-century connoisseurship with its emphasis on the antique the high renaissance the bolognese school and rubens.zoffany painted the picture in florence expressly for queen charlotte beginning in 1772",
